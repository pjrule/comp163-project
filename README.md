# Computational Geometry Final Project

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pjrule/comp163-project/blob/master/Low-dimensional%20linear%20programming.ipynb)

This repository contains the notebook for my COMP163 final project. I implemented the Megiddo's O(n) algorithm for linear programming in RÂ², the Graham scan, a duality transform, and a line segment intersection algorithm.

## Running
This notebook has very few dependencies. It is intended to be run in JupyterLab using Python 3.6 or above; it depends on Matplotlib and NumPy.
To install this dependencies, run
`pip install jupyterlab matplotlib numpy`

Execute `jupyter lab` to view the notebook.
